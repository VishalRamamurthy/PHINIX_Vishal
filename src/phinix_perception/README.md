2D and 3D perception for PHINIX

This repository contains the perception stack for PHINIX. 

Perception stack is designed to be sensor agnostic. Hence it requires a sensor abstarction layer to be launched which can be found [here](https://github.com/ximira-org/phinix_perception/tree/main/src/general/phinix_sensor_abstractor).
